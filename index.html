Dear all,
<p>
July 16, 2012 marks the first anniversary of Pat's death.
<p>
I was dismayed to discover recently, quite by accident, that Pat's last 
three newsletters, 98, 99 and 100, had not, as I had assumed, been 
posted on the web. Pat had worked desperately to reach 100, and they 
were completed two weeks before he died, but events overtook us.
<p>
Gihan Perera, <a href="http://gihanperera.com/" onClick="xpop=0">http://gihanperera.com/</a> has freely given his time so that 
Pat's work remains on the web, and he has enabled these last 
newsletters to be posted. 
<p>
I am deeply indebted to Gihan, and I thank him most sincerely.

Welcome to the <i><b>Metrication&nbsp;matters</b></i> home page. My name is Pat Naughtin and, firstly, let me say that this web site is based on these beliefs:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The metric system is profoundly and fundamentally more honest than any previous measuring method.
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The metric system, because of its profound honesty promotes better communication between all of the people in the world.
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The adoption of the metric system by all people everywhere in the world is inevitable and therefore unstoppable.
</ul>
<p>

<p>
<H3>And just for fun ...</H3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>If you truly believe that the metric system is wrong, you might like to consider not using the metric system at all. This article <a href="http://metricationmatters.org/docs/DontUseMetric.pdf" onClick="xpop=0">Don't use metric</a> will help get you started.
</ul>
<p>
<H3>Why <i><b>Metrication&nbsp;matters</b></i></H3>
<p>
I will now explain why I maintain the <i><b>Metrication&nbsp;matters</b></i> web site and why I produce the monthly <i><b>Metrication&nbsp;matters</b></i> newsletter.
<p>
I firmly believe that the world will be a better, safer, and far more honest place when we are all using the same metric system as everybody else. Simply put, I truly believe that <i><b>Metrication&nbsp;matters</b></i>. I also believe that the resources you will find here will help you make your inevitable metrication upgrade smooth, rapid, economical and, above all, fast.
<p>
To me, honesty is the key benefit of the metric system. The honesty and simplicity of the metric system have proved to make its success inevitable for all the people of the world. Many previous measuring methods were profoundly dishonest and many of these are still in use.
<p>
I intend that the resources you will find here will help you develop greater honesty in all of your measurements from measuring inside atoms, to setting out your pages to save trees, to remodelling your kitchen or bathroom, to measure climate changes, or to measuring the size of the whole Universe.

<H3>What is metrication - and why does it matter?</H3>
<b><i>Metrication</i></b> is the process of upgrading to the metric system. <b><i>Metrication</i></b> describes any smooth, fast, and economical upgrade to the metric system. <b><i>Metrication</i></b> is the direct transition process that helps you to quickly, efficiently, easily, and relatively cheaply upgrade from any of the various old pre-metric measuring methods to the modern metric system.<br>
<H4>Put simply</H4>
<b><i>Metrication</i></b> is the process of changing from all of the old many millions of words previously linked with measurements to the simplicity of the modern metric system. See <a href="http://metricationmatters.org/docs/SIMetricUnitsVsUSAMeasures.pdf" onClick="xpop=0">http://metricationmatters.org/docs/SIMetricUnitsVsUSAMeasures.pdf</a> 
<p>
<center><b><i>
<i><b>Metrication&nbsp;matters</b></i> is recognised worldwide as a leading provider of simple and practical metric system resources and services.
<p>
At '<i><b>Metrication&nbsp;matters</b></i>' we understand the metric system and the metrication process and we can show you how you, and your organisation, can upgrade fully to the metric system quickly, cheaply, and easily.
<p>
Well planned and well conducted metrication can be typically completed within a year. Learning and familiarisation with the metric system - if well planned and conducted - can be completed in a single day.
<p>
After your metrication upgrade you can expect decreased costs and increased profits.</i>

<p>
At <i><b><i><b>Metrication&nbsp;matters</b></i></b></i> we believe the best way to upgrade to the metric system is by the quick and direct <b><i>metrication</i></b> process. <b><i>Metrication</i></b> is not the same as metric conversion.
<p>
You can develop your confidence to do this by finding out why you should use the metric system here [<a href="http://metricationmatters.org/why_metrication.html" onClick="xpop=0">http://metricationmatters.org/why_metrication.html</a> Why metrication? and use some of these discussion points when you are talking to others to support the metric system.
<p>
One of the most remarkable things about the metric system is that it is so successful. Pat Naughtin has observed that:<br>
<center><b>No individual, no group, no company, no industry, and no nation,<br>
after using the metric system for some time,<br>
has ever gone back to using old pre-metric measures.</b></center>
<p>
And Pat is not alone in thinking like this. More than 100 years ago, in 1906, <b>Alexander Graham Bell,</b> made this statement to the <b>Congress of the USA,</b><br>

<dd><i>It is safe to say that after the metric system has been adopted by the U.S. and our people have become accustomed to its use we would no more dream of going back to the present system of weights and measures than we would think of carrying on the processes of arithmetic through the medium of the old Roman letters in place of the Arabic numerals we now employ.</i></dd><br>
</dl>
<p>
<center>
<H3>From these observations it is easy to conclude that the success of the metric system is inevitable.</H3>

<H2><i><b>Metrication&nbsp;matters</b></i> for your company</H2>
<p>
Pat Naughtin, our principle speaker says, 'I ask people "Why metrication matters to you?" whenever I give keynote speeches or run training seminars'.
<p>
These comments are from feedback sheets written by people in companies that have had successful metrication transitions. Participants completed the line:
<p>
<b>'After successful metrication there is ... '</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>	Better morale<br>
<li>	Greater accuracy<br>
<li>	Greater customer happiness<br>
<li>	Less customer unhappiness<br>
<li>	Less cheating<br>
<li>	Less mistakes<br>
<li>	Less repeating things<br>
<li>	Less staying back to fix things not done right first time around<br>
<li>	Management sleeping better at night<br>

<li>	More pleasant working atmosphere<br>
<li>	More togetherness because we all feel better valued<br>
<li>	People feeling valued because of less niggling over errors<br>
<li>	Shorter meetings
</ul>
<p>
<b>Clearly, metrication matters to many people and for many reasons.</b>
<p>
One of the most remarkable things about the metric system is that it is so successful. 
<p>
Knowing that no individual, no group, no company, no industry, and no nation, after using the metric system for some time, has ever gone back to using old pre-metric measures means that we can confidently predict the future of the metric system.
<p>
<center><b><i>Whenever you are considering the future of the metric system,<br>
anywhere in the world and in any industry,<br>
don't ever doubt that metrication matters,<br>
and that upgrading to the metric system is inevitable.</i></b></center>
<p>
At <b><i>metricationmatters.org</i></b> we believe that metrication matters in all aspects of your life from moments after your birth, when you are first measured, to just after your death, when you are measured for your final funeral ritual. We also know that metrication matters in every aspect of your life from the time you rise in the morning to when you go to bed at night; in all activities all through your life - <b><i>metrication matters</i></b>.
<p>
If you require more help we provide a telephone consulting service and a person-to-person consultation service. We charge for these services. The basis of our work with individuals is to provide written resources and guided checklists so that you can make your own progress at your own rate at little cost.
<p>
As we tailor all presentations to suit individual clients and their current needs, we visit your premises to consult with your staff before we undertake presentations. We charge for these services and for travel and accommodation. Generally, we like to have a half-day orientation of your work sites so we can specifically address your current measurement issues.
<p>
<H3><i><b>Metrication&nbsp;matters</b></i> because:</H3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>	metrication makes your businesses more profitable,<br>
<li>	metrication makes your calculations simpler,<br>
<li>	metrication makes your cooking easier and more reliable,<br>
<li>	metrication makes your costs less,<br>
<li>	metrication makes your dealings with others more open and honest,<br>
<li>	metrication makes your export income greater,<br>
<li>	metrication makes your imported goods cheaper,<br>
<li>	metrication makes your international dealings friendlier,<br>
<li>	metrication makes your learning easier,<br>
<li>	metrication makes your lives safer and more secure,<br>
<li>	metrication makes your schools and colleges more effective, and<br>
<li>	metrication makes your work more efficient.
</ul>
<p>
Remember that <b><i>metrication</i></b> is not the same as metric conversion. Metric conversion is another way that might eventually lead you to using the metric system. However:
<p>
<ul>
<li>metric conversion is much more difficult than direct metrication,<br>
<li>metric conversion is much slower than direct metrication, and<br>
<li>metric conversion is more costly than direct metrication.
</ul>
<p>

<p>
You have probably arrived at this web page because you are have discovered the ease of using the metric system and you want to help others to form the same belief and to act on it. At <i><i><b>Metrication&nbsp;matters</b></i></i> we may be able to help you.
<p>
The purpose of the <i><i><b>Metrication&nbsp;matters</b></i></i> web site is to influence your decision about <b>when</b> and how <b>quickly</b> you will <b>upgrade</b> to the metric system.
<p>
We say <b>when</b> because we have no doubt that <b>you will</b> make your own metrication upgrade - that's inevitable - all you have to decide is when, and how quickly you will do it.
<p>
A secondary purpose of this web site is to encourage you to develop as a metrication leader so that other people can learn more about the metric system from you.
<p>
At <b><i>metricationmatters.org</i></b> we are extremely interested in the question:
<p>
<H4>What makes your metrication upgrade smooth, simple, and above all <b><i>fast</i></b>?</H4>
<p>
At <i><b>Metrication&nbsp;matters</b></i> we have spent many years studying how individuals, groups, companies, industries, and even whole nations approach metrication.
<p>
We have studied many smooth, simple, and rapid metric transitions and, sadly, we have also seen some that are badly planned, badly co-ordinated, and, till now,  unsuccessful attempts at metric conversion.
<p>
Based on our experience, we are able to help you with:
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="writing.html" onClick="xpop=0">writing, editing, publishing</a>, and 
<li><a href="speaking.html" onClick="xpop=0">consulting and speaking services.</a>
</ul>
<p>
<H4>We help individuals, groups, companies, and industries make a smooth and rapid metric transition.</H4>

<H3>We work with:</H3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>all industries, because the metric system is universal and can be successfully applied to all trades, crafts, professions, companies, industries, and nations.

</ul>
<p>
<H4><i><b>Metrication&nbsp;matters</b></i> achieves its goals through:</H4>
<p>
<ul>
<li>presentations for management to help form measurement and metrication policy.
<li>keynote presentations that present the metric system in a humorous yet serious way, to help overcome cultural resistance to your metrication program.
<li>presentations for middle management to help implement your company's metrication policy.
<li>presentations for training your staff to improve their competence and confidence with the metric system.
<li>radio and TV interviews and talks.
<li>presentations for staff who are complaining about having to use the metric system.

<li>presentations for members of the public who have an interest in the metric system.
<li>direct and interactive consulting for those who have to develop metric system and metrication policies.
<li>the provision of information and support for education and training professionals.

<p>
We believe that the (gloriously named) French philosopher, Marie Jean Antoine Nicolas de Caritat, Le Marquis de Condorcet (1743/1794) described the metric system brilliantly when he said that it was:
<center>
<H2>"For all people, for all time"</H2>
